##Planning
For a meat lover like me, and driver of the grill, it is common to be asked to make a barbecue for family and friends.
Since the price of good beef in our region is expensive, we commonly gather funds and with the money we buy all stuff needed.
So i will create a small application to estimate the cost of a good barbecue to our good people. 
The idea is to calculate the amount of food and other items we would need.

At first, i plan to create meat classes, with categories: Golden, Silver and Bronze. Of course "Picanha" will be the prime (rump cap for you).
Receiving the number of people, sorting and separating by gender (it's only for quantity purpose) and calculating an average value in kilograms.
With that, we also hint drink and item ammount.

Additionaly, if possible, to create an option of suggestions and how do choose the meat for the barbecue.
